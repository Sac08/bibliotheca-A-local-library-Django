# bibliotheca-A-library-Management-System-In-Django
                           Borrowing books, returning books or viewing the available books at the Library of the local University is currently done manually where in the student has to go to the Library and check the available books at the Library. Students check the list of books available and borrow the books if the book is a borrow book otherwise it is of waste for the student to come to the library to come to check for the books if the student doesnâ€™t get the book. Then the librarian checks the student id and allows the member to check out the book and the librarian then updates the member database and also the books database. This takes at least one to two hours if the member is available at the near by place otherwise it may take more time.
                   I have decided to investigate the use of an Online Library Management System. This system would be used by members who may be students or professors of that College to check the availability of the books and borrow the books, and by the librarian to update the databases.(You can check details about bibliotheca in doc folder)
